Hi,

Below are the details of Amazon EC2 server for Team #9

Username: force
Hostname: ec2-54-169-233-60.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com

You need to use the attached pem file to SSH into the server.

if you are using windows laptops, you need to convert pem file to .ppk file using puttygen and then connect to remote server using the generated.ppk file. refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html for more information.

Thanks
